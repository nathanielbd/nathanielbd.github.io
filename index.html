    <h1 id="About me"> About me </h1>
    <h2> Education </h2>
    <p> I'm a current undergraduate student at the <span>University of Minnesota - Twin Cities</span>. I study <span>Computer Science</span> with a <span>Bioinformatics and Computational Biology</span> upper division track and <span>Mathematics</span> with a <span>Genomics</span> specialization. I expect to graduate in Spring 2021. I'm interested in graduate school.
    </p>
    <p>I've taken classes on algorithms, data structures, functional programming, operating systems, machine architecture, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and multivariable calculus.</p>
    <p>At UMN-TC, I am involved in <span>Quiz Bowl</span>, <span>Copter Club</span>, and the <span>Business Association of Multicultural Students</span>.</p>
    <p>As a Minnetonka High School student, I achieved <span>National AP Scholar</span>, 3x <span>Gold Presidential Volunteer Service award</span>, and <span>National Merit Commended Student</span> honors. Beginning in my final year of high school, I enrolled in college-level courses at the <span>University of Minnesota - Twin Cities</span>. I've been coding in some way or form since middle school, but we don't speak about the writing-a-website-on-Notepad days.
    </p>
    <h2> Interests </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Bioinformatics</span></li><br>

        <li><span>Quantitative Finance</span></li><br>
    </ul>
    <h3> Interests that aren't "boring" </h3>
    <p> I play video games-- both new and old. Sometimes 'old' means <span>Street Fighter II</span>. Other times it means <span>Spacewar!</span>. You'll often find me playing an emulated <span>SNES</span>, <span>PS1</span>, or <span>DS</span> game.</p>
    <p> If you catch me when I have free time, I'll probably be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>reading or discussing history online,</li><br>
        <li>reading a novel, possibly by <span>Douglas Adams</span>,</li><br>
        <li>playing a video game made in the last century,</li><br>
        <li>playing a board game,</li><br>
        <li>watching the <span>NFL</span>,</li><br>
        <li>or finding the prettiest dark theme for my text editor</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="My code"> My code </h1>
    <p> I've coded with:</p>
    <ul>
            <li><span>Java</span></li>
            <li><span>Python</span></li>
            <li><span>JavaScript</span></li>
            <li><span>OCaml</span></li>
            <li><span>R</span></li>
            <li><span>C</span></li>
            <li><span>Assembly</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have experience with technologies including <span>numpy</span>, <span>pandas</span>, <span>Flask</span>, <span>Google Cloud Platform</span>, <span>Node.js</span>, <span>Keras</span>, <span>tensorflow</span>, <span>Cytoscape</span>, and <span>Mathematica</span>. I've used these in some personal projects. </p>
    <h2> cold crisp catnap </h2>
    <img title="a sarcastic interaction in 'cold crisp catnap'" src="ccc.png"/>
    <h5 style="font-size:1em;">a sarcastic interaction in 'cold crisp catnap'</h5>
    <p> Have you ever wanted to re-experience the thrill of out-smarting the <span>Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal</span> (however easy it may be)? The feeling of accomplishment after routing the <span>Wizard of Frobozz</span>? The dread of being eaten by <span>a grue</span>?</p>
    <p> Maybe none of those things applied to you; but if you, for some reason, wanted to play a text adventure webgame not quite as wittily written as the original '80s <span>Zork Trilogy</span>, <a href="https://cold-crisp-catnap.neocities.org">you can do that here</a>. </p>
    <p> Alternatively, you could view <a href="https://github.com/nathanielbd/cold-crisp-catnap">the project's code</a>. For some unknown reason, my high school self made it with client-side <span>JavaScript</span>.</p>
    <h2> Copter Club </h2>
    <p> I'm a member of my university's <a href="https://gopherlink.umn.edu/organization/3245">Copter Club</a>. The student group enters competitions for the autonomous flight, remote sensing, and navigation of multi-rotor copters. I contribute to the code used for the <a href="www.auvsi-suas.org">2019 AUVSI SUAS competition</a>.</p>
    <h2> The Sick Shrimp Project </h2>
    <img title="a screencap of the Sick Shrimp Project webapp" src="sick.png"/>
    <h5 style="font-size:1em;">a screencap of the Sick Shrimp Project webapp</h5>
    <p> I participated in <a href="https://minnehack.io">MinneHack 2019</a>, the largest hackathon in the Twin Cities. In less than 24 hours, my group created <a href="https://sick-shrimp.appspot.com">The Sick Shrimp Project</a>, a webapp that assembles information on various factors for White Spot Virus and Early Mortality Syndrome in 
        aquacultural shrimp and employs a neural network to classify images of shrimp as either 'healthy' or 'infected' by the two ailments.</p>

    <h1 id="Self-learning"> Self-learning </h1>
    <p>I'm an autodidact. I learn stuff outside of school.</p>
    <p> I mostly learn and practice coding personal projects. However, one of my favorite topics is protein folding.
        I follow the <span>CASP</span> experiments and some of their highest performing teams. I'm interested in novel <b>de novo</b> and <b>ab initio</b> methods to predict protein
        structure from amino acid sequence. I'm also interested in the <b>de novo</b> design of proteins.
    </p>
    <p>On my list of things to learn in the future are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Bash</span> scripting for bioinformatics research</li><br>
        <li>Compeau and Pevzner's Bioinformatics Algorithms MOOC</li><br>
        <li>EliteDataScience's Machine Learning Self-starter</li><br>
        <li>How to juggle</li><br>
        <li><span>Underwater Basket Weaving</span></li>
    </ul>
    <center><a href="#">Back to top</a></center>

    <h1 id="Stuff for employers"> Stuff for employers </h1>
    <p> I'm actively seeking software development, bioinformatics, computational biology, machine learning, and data science internships and research opportunities.

    <p> There's not much you'd want to know about me that isn't on this page, my Linkedin, or my résumé. If I had to highlight something implicit, it would be my 
        transferable skills of communication from my tutoring experience. Recruiters, please feel free to email me.

    <p> That file icon on the far right is my résumé, by the way.</p>
