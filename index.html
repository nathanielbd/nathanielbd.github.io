<h1> about me </h1>
<h2> education</h2>
<p> I'm at student at the <span>University of Minnesota - Twin Cities</span>. I study <span>Computer Science</span> with a Bioinformatics and Computational Biology upper division track and <span>Mathematics</span>. I've been coding in some way or form since middle school, but we don't speak about the coding-a-website-on-notepad days. </p>
<h2> interests</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bioinformatics</li>
    <li>Computational Biology</li>
    <li>Functional Genomics</li>
    <li>Machine Learning</li>
    <li>Machine Learning-assisted Discovery</li>
    <li>Computational Chemistry</li>
    <li>Quantitative Finance</li>
</ul>
<h3> oh, you meant my <i>hobby</i> interests? </h3>
<p> I play video games-- both new and old. Sometimes 'old' means <span>Street Fighter II</span>. Other times it means <span>Spacewar!</span>.</p>
<p> If you catch me when I have free time, I'll probably be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>reading or discussing history online,</li><br>
    <li>reading a novel, possibly by <span>Douglas Adams</span>,</li><br>
    <li>playing a video game made in the last century,</li><br>
    <li>playing a board game,</li><br>
    <li>or finding the prettiest dark theme for my IDE</li>
</ul>

<h1> my code  </h1>
<h2> project: cold crisp catnap </h2>
<img src="ccc.png"/>
<p> Have you ever wanted to re-experience the thrill of out-smarting the <span>Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal</span> (however easy it may be)? The feeling of accomplishment after routing the <span>Wizard of Frobozz</span>? The dread of being eaten by <span>a grue</span>?</p>
<p> Maybe none of those things applied to you, but if you, for some reason, wanted to play a text adventure webgame not quite as wittily written as the original <span>Zork Trilogy</span>, <a href="https://cold-crisp-catnap.neocities.org">you can do that</a>. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you could view <a href="https://github.com/nathanielbd/cold-crisp-catnap">the project's code</a>. For some unknown reason, my high school self made it with client-side <span>JavaScript</span>.</p>
<h2> project: copter club code </h2>
<p> I'm a member of my university's <a href="https://gopherlink.umn.edu/organization/3245">Copter Club</a>. The student group enters competitions for the autonomous flight, remote sensing, and navigation of multi-rotor copters. I contribute to the code used for the <a href="www.auvsi-suas.org">2019 AUVSI SUAS competition</a>.</p>

<h1> self-learning </h1>
<p> I'm an autodidact. I learn stuff outside of school. On my list of things to learn in the future are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span>R</span> programming for data analysis, which I would apply in bioinformatics research</li><br>
    <li>How to juggle</li>
</ul>
