      <title>Hacking the Normie Test</title>

      <description>The Normie Test is a quiz with ~40 questions that places the taker on a two-axes plot relative to internet culture personality classes like &amp;lsquo;normies&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;simps.&amp;rsquo;
        Apparently EDM is mainstream now?    Notably, the quiz is not open source and it runs on server-side PHP. How is X calculated? How is Y calculated? Why am I a &amp;lsquo;Simp&amp;rsquo; if my X-coordinate is over the line by 0.</description>

      <description>If I had to explain to someone the paradigm of deep learning, I&amp;rsquo;d start by mentioning
The Perceptron Given
\(X\), an \(n \times m\) matrix where each row \(x\) is a data vector with \(m\) features,
\(w\), a vector of \(m\) weights,
\(b\), a bias value,
define a function \(f\):
$$f(x) = \begin{cases}1 &amp;amp; \text{if } w \cdot x + b &amp;gt; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$
The task of predicting a class \(d\) of some row \(x\) can be solved via an iteratively-improving algorithm thought to be &amp;lsquo;trained&amp;rsquo; with the data in \(X\).</description>

For readers of this blog:
I use KaTeX for math typesetting. When I embed GitHub gists, I add this CSS (as a Hugo partial). When the GitHub gist is a .csv file I add the following CSS:
.gist .markdown-body .csv-data th, .gist .markdown-body .csv-data td, .gist .markdown-body .csv-data .</description>

      <title>Unexpected Lessons from breaking Webgames</title>
      <link>https://nathanielbd.github.io/posts/breaking-webgames/</link>

      <description>One of the reasons I started programming was to code exploits in webgames. The other reason involves a certain 1980s text adventure, but that is a story for another day.
        Almost as sarcastic as Zork, but in first person    Looking back, I realize that this unconventional way of getting into programming exposed me to several important concepts early. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a few from the perspective of a programming noob.</description>

      <title>How I used Manim with WSL and data points</title>

      <description>I recently (last night) submitted my video entry for the Breakthrough Junior Challenge 2020, a competition for students aged 13-18 to submit a video explaining a topic in physics, life sciences, or math in a 3 minute video. In a competition filled with entries with amazing Adobe After Effects and Element 3D editors, I sought to be unique among the 10,000 competitors by using Grant Sanderson/3Blue1Brown&amp;rsquo;s math animation engine, Manim. The source code for my video can be found here.</description>

Introduction         Polizei make Segways go brrr    Segways are pretty cool, and they can be the perfect segue into talking about control theory.
Segways need a robust mechanism for correcting itself in order to self-balance.</description>

      <description>My name is Nathaniel Budijono.
I&amp;rsquo;m a life-long autodidact currently studying computer science and math at the University of Minnesota. You can view my résumé here and my CV here.
Learning things is my ultimate pursuit. I like to write about the learning and teaching process as well as the applications of programming and math to games.
When I&amp;rsquo;m not learning, I can often be found board gaming, video gaming, or following compelling stories.</description>
