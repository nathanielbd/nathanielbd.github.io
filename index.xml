      <description>This content was created as part of an educational workshop for SASE Labs UMN, of which I served as director from 2020-2021. Check out the demo here.

      <description>My name is Nathaniel Budijono.
I&amp;rsquo;m a life-long autodidact currently studying computer science and math at the University of Minnesota. You can view my résumé here.
Learning things is my ultimate pursuit. I believe in open educational resources. I like to write about the learning and teaching process.
When I&amp;rsquo;m not learning, I can often be found board gaming, video gaming, or watching something funny.
Feel free to contact me through email or submit a pull request if you think I wrote something inaccurate.</description>
