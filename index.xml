      <description>One of the reasons I started programming was to code exploits in webgames. The other reason involves a certain 1980s text adventure, but that is a story for another day.
        Almost as sarcastic as Zork, but in first person    Looking back, I realize that this unconventional way of getting into programming exposed me to several important concepts early. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a few from the perspective of a programming noob.</description>

      <description>I recently (last night) submitted my video entry for the Breakthrough Junior Challenge 2020, a competition for students aged 13-18 to submit a video explaining a topic in physics, life sciences, or math in a 3 minute video. In a competition filled with entries with amazing Adobe After Effects and Element 3D editors, I sought to be unique among the 10,000 competitors by using Grant Sanderson/3Blue1Brown&amp;rsquo;s math animation engine, Manim. The source code for my video can be found here.</description>

      <description>This content was created as part of an educational workshop for SASE Labs UMN, of which I served as director from 2020-2021. Check out the demo here.
Introduction         Polizei make Segways go brrr    Segways are pretty cool, and they can be the perfect segue into talking about control theory.
Segways need a robust mechanism for correcting itself in order to self-balance.</description>

      <description>My name is Nathaniel Budijono.
I&amp;rsquo;m a life-long autodidact currently studying computer science and math at the University of Minnesota. You can view my résumé here.
Learning things is my ultimate pursuit. I believe in open educational resources. I like to write about the learning and teaching process.
When I&amp;rsquo;m not learning, I can often be found board gaming, video gaming, or watching something funny.
Feel free to contact me through email or submit a pull request if you think I wrote something inaccurate.</description>
