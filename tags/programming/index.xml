      <description>This is part two of my series on Lenstra&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm. See part one here for the intuition for the algorithm.
 In part one, we saw that Lenstra&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm can intuitively be understood as an algorithm literally built to fail. We repeatedly add a point to itself on an elliptic curve modulo the number to be factored and wait until a failure to compute a modular multiplicative inverse occurs. Because when that happens, it means that the GCD of the number to be factored and another number is non-zero.</description>

      <description>This is my entry for 3blue1brown&amp;rsquo;s first summer of math exposition (SoME1). I&amp;rsquo;m glad to report it was one of the top 100/1200+ entries and that Grant Sanderson ranked it as one of his favorite written entries!
 There&amp;rsquo;s no question that elliptic curves are incredibly important to math and cryptography.
        Elliptic curve cryptography spotted in Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s security certificate    It was the key to Andrew Wiles&amp;rsquo;s famous proof of Fermat&amp;rsquo;s Last Theorem.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Lessons from breaking Webgames</title>

      <description>One of the reasons I started programming was to code exploits in webgames. The other reason involves a certain 1980s text adventure, but that is a story for another day.
        Almost as sarcastic as Zork, but in first person    Looking back, I realize that this unconventional way of getting into programming exposed me to several important concepts early. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a few from the perspective of a programming noob.</description>
