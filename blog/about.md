This is the blog of Nathaniel Budijono, known on github as nathanielbd.

I'm an autodidact, student, aspiring computational STEMer, and programmer. Probably in that order.

Here, I'll probably write about some things I like about the world and some things I've learned along the way while teaching myself stuff.
